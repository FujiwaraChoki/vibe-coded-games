# Vibe Games

A modern gaming application built with Next.js and Three.js, featuring interactive 3D games with advanced physics and visual effects.

## 🎮 Features

- **Multiple Games**:

  - **Quantum Drift**: Navigate a spacecraft through different quantum realms, each with unique physics properties
  - **Ocean Voyager**: Sail across a dynamic ocean, facing changing weather conditions and collecting treasures

- **Rich 3D Environments**: Detailed 3D worlds powered by Three.js
- **Realistic Physics**: Accurate movement and environmental effects
- **Dynamic Weather System**: Weather changes that affect gameplay
- **Responsive Controls**: Intuitive keyboard controls with smooth movement

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- [Next.js 15.2](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework with app router
- [React 19](https://react.dev/) - UI library
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - 3D graphics library
- [TailwindCSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) - Incremental bundler

## 🎯 Game Controls

### Quantum Drift

- **W/↑**: Move Forward
- **S/↓**: Move Backward
- **A/←**: Move Left
- **D/→**: Move Right
- **SPACE**: Fire Laser Beams
- **1-4**: Switch between quantum realms

## 📘 Quantum Realms

- **Regular Space**: Standard physics with balanced movement
- **Low Gravity**: Floaty movement with less drag and higher speed
- **High Density**: Heavy resistance with higher drag and slower movement
- **Probability**: Unpredictable movement with quantum randomness

## 🌊 Ocean Features

- Dynamic ocean with realistic wave simulation
- Weather changes (calm, windy, foggy, stormy)
- Islands, hazards, treasures, and power-ups

## 🚢 Building for Production
